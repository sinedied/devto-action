> GitHub Action to publish markdown files as articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to) platform, with assets hosted on GitHub.

## Usage

See [this template repository](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-github-template) for usage and setup.

## How does it work?

This github action delegates most of the work to the [devto-cli](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-cli) push command.

You can find more information about how it works in the [CLI readme](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-cli).
